# 🪨 Rock-Type Pokémon Data Analysis

Welcome to our project for the **Programming course (G02)** in the **Data Engineering and Artificial Intelligence** program. This repository contains the code, visualizations, and insights derived from analyzing **rock-type Pokémon** using data science tools in Python.

## 📊 Objective

This project aims to apply fundamental data analysis and visualization techniques using:
- **pandas** for data manipulation and cleaning,
- **numpy** for statistical operations,
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for visualizations.

Our focus is on understanding the behavior and characteristics of **rock-type Pokémon** within the larger Pokémon dataset.

## 🔗 Dataset

We used the public Pokémon dataset available at Kaggle:  
[https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rounakbanik/pokemon)

## 📁 Files Included

- `rock_type_analysis.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook containing all the analysis and visualizations (in English).
- `presentation.pdf` or `presentation_slides/`: Slide presentation prepared for the final delivery.
- `README.md`: This file.

## 🔍 Key Analyses

1. **Count of Rock-Type Pokémon**  
2. **Power Distribution**  
   - Histogram and boxplots
   - Most powerful and weakest Pokémon
3. **Defense Stats**
4. **Gender Distribution**
5. **Legendary Status**
6. **Damage Relations with Other Types**
7. **Speed, Height, and Weight Analysis**
8. **Strategic Pokémon Selection for Tournaments**

## 🧠 Insights

We identified:
- The strongest and weakest rock-type Pokémon.
- How rock-type Pokémon perform against other types.
- Which ones are legendary.
- Statistical distributions and outliers for key attributes like speed, height, and weight.

## 🧩 Tools Used

- Python 3
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## 🎯 Best Rock-Type Pokémon for Battle

Based on our analysis, we selected the most effective rock-type Pokémon for strategic battles, considering power, speed, defense, and type advantages.
